    Meet To Do App, the ideal app for managing your daily tasks! With it, you can create, edit, delete, and filter your tasks in a simple and practical way. Take advantage of local storage with SQLite for offline access and synchronization with the cloud database via Firestore to keep your tasks always up to date on any device, along with full authentication provided by Firebase. The "Doc.md" file in the project root folder contains all the development and architecture documentation for the application.
